the algo is pretty much the same, but the thing was the program label was **MD13** (which was for Mass Downloader 1.3.x initially, i suppose so), and this has 570 bytes of RSA encryption (**RSA-570** more exactly).
and the whole list of blacklisted names is so huge it took me an hour to copy and paste them into my algo from IDA pro (see **blacklist.inc**).
